# Overwatch 3

Overwatch 3 is my hobby project developed with only Unreal Engine 4 Blueprint. I became so sick of Overwatch 2 delays that I decided to start developing Overwatch 3 myself. Hopefully before year 2030 I'll finish this grand project for people to play when they still don't have access to Overwatch 2. JK

Okay so basically this is my practice to rebuild some of the features in Overwatch using Unreal Engine 4, including a basic layout for the practice range, some AI enemies, a basic UI and handful of heros in the hopefully near future. I'm not a good environment artist so the aesthetic is kept to minimum. After it started, you can navigate yourself in the map and try out different stuff, attack the Ai enemy, pick up health packs, and don't forget, you can change character in the menu by pressing keyboard H.

1. UI (To be finished)

2. Character switching menu

3. Shooting range

A basic blueprint elevator, activated when stepped on
A physics enabled shooting target
Some enemy AI, will fire slow bullets when player is in sight
A health pack to provide 25 HP when consumed. The health pack respawns after 2 seconds. The health pack will not be consumed if the player HP is maxHP (100).

4. Playground
Several roaming AI running back and forth following preset way points.
